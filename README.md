> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript 
>specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has 
>curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

## content

We won’t spend much book space or your time on countless listings of functions
and available methods on every single object. This type of information can be
easily looked up and practiced online on demand from Mozilla’s MDN web docs,
W3Schools and StackOverflow.

Much of content of this book is tailored to modern JavaScript development, which
leans toward >= EcmaScript6 specification, functional programming: the use of
higher-order Array functions, arrow functions and understanding execution context.
