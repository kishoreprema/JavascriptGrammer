# Javascript Learning

> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript 
>specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has 
>curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

## content

We won’t spend much book space or your time on countless listings of functions
and available methods on every single object. This type of information can be
easily looked up and practiced online on demand from Mozilla’s MDN web docs,
W3Schools and StackOverflow.

Much of content of this book is tailored to modern JavaScript development, which
leans toward >= EcmaScript6 specification, functional programming: the use of
higher-order Array functions, arrow functions and understanding execution context.


## Presentation Format

Namely: imports, classes, constructors, key principles behind functional programming, including many features ranging from ES5 - ES10 These are all covered in this Documentaion


## Chrome Console
Many of them know only Chrome’s `console.log` but the console API contains few other methods that console methods are explained below

## copy:

Copying JSON representation of an existing object to copy buffer:

    let object = { property1 : 1, property1 : 2, method : function(){} };
    copy(object);

It returns only JSON. `JSON string format does not support methods,only properties and value pair`

## console dir

If you want to look at all the object’s properties and methods,you can use console.dir method:

`console.dir(object)`

    let object = { property1 : 1, property1 : 2, method : function(){} };
    console.dir(object);
    Output : 👇
    > Object
        >method: ƒ ()
         property1: 2
        >[[Prototype]]: Object

`console.dir(document.body)`
you can look at the output DOM elements:

    console.dir(document.body);
    Output : 👇
    > body
        aLink: ""
        accessKey: ""
        ariaAtomic: null
        ariaAutoComplete: null
        ariaBusy: null
        ariaChecked: null
        ariaColCount: null


## console error
    
    let value = 50;
    function start() {
        function end() {
            console.error("Function Ended");
        }
        if(value > 50) {
            //ok
        }else {
            end();
        }
    }
    start();  //function call

console.error is provides the stack trace:

    output : 👇
    Function Ended
        end         @ VM429:4
        start       @ VM429:9
        (anonymous) @ VM429:12


## console time

The `console.time()` method starts a timer you can use to track how long an operation takes. You give each timer a unique name, and may have up to `10,000 timers running` on a given page. When you call `console.timeEnd()` with the same name, the browser will output the time, in `milliseconds`, that elapsed since the timer was started.

You can track the amount of time between function calls. This can be helpful
when optimizing code:
    
    console.time();
    let arr = Array(1000);
    for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
        arr[i] = new Object();
    }
    console.timeEnd();                                                                                         

## console clear
This method clears the console
            
    console.clear();

Printing Objects :

In JavaScript all objects have .toString() method. When providing an object sto console.log(value) it can print it either as an object, or as a string.

    let obj = {};
    console.log(obj);
    console.log("object = " + obj);
    console.log( `${obj}` );

## Entry Point

Every computer program has an entry point.

You can start writing your code directly into `<script>` tags. But this means it
will be executed instantly and simultaneously as the script is being downloaded
into the browser, without concern for DOM or other media.

This can create a problem because your code might be accessing DOM elements
before they are fully downloaded from the server.
To avoid this situation, you may want to wait until the DOM tree is fully available.

`addEventListener :`
The document.addEventListener() method attaches an event handler (event written in function) to the document (HTML Document).

`DOMContentLoaded event :`
The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
*A different event, load, should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page. It is a common mistake to use load where DOMContentLoaded would be more appropriate.*

Check it out : 👉 https://github.com/sundharwinston/JavascriptGrammer/blob/main/views/chapter3/DOMContentLoaded.ejs
## readyState

The `document.readyState` property describes the loading state of the document.
When the value of this property changes, a readystatechange event execute the document object.

`Values :`
The readyState of a document value can be following one 
`loading`
    The document is still loading.
`interactive`
    The document has finished loading and the document has been parsed but sub-resources such as scripts, images, stylesheets and frames are still loading.
`complete`
    The document and all sub-resources have finished loading. The state indicates that the load event is to execute.
`Readystatechanges`
Example : 👉 https://github.com/sundharwinston/JavascriptGrammer/blob/main/views/chapter3/readystate.ejs
Refer   : 👉 https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#event-readystatechange

## DOM vs Media

We’ve just created a safe place for initializing our application. But because DOM is simply a tree-like structure of all HTML elements on the page, it usually becomes available before the rest of the media such as images and various embeds.
Even though <image src = "http://url" /> is a DOM element, the URL content specified in image’s src attribute might take more time to load.
To check if any non-DOM media content has finished downloading we can overload
the native window.onload event as shown in the following example.

`what is window`
The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
1.All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. like
2.`Global variables are properties` of the window object.
3.`Global functions are methods` of the window object.

Examples : window.open(); | close() 

`window.onload`
This method can wait until all images and similar media have been fully downloaded.

## Including External Scripts
Check it out : 👉

## Import  
Starting from ES6 we should use import (and export) keyword to import variables,
functions and classes from an external file.
To make a variable, object or a function available for export, the export
keyword must be prepended to its definition.
Not everything in a module will be exported. Some of the items will remain private to it. Be sure to prepend export keyword to anything you want to export from the file.

`script type = "module"`
Whenever to export the class and start using it in the application, we must make sure the script tag’s type attribute is changed to `module` (this is required.)

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
          <head>
              <title>Import Module</title>
              <script type="module">
                import { Your class } from "./file";
                /* definition */
              </script>
          </head>
          <body>
          
          </body>
      </html>

## Importing And Exporting Multiple Definitions
To import multiple items (class/variable etc.) from two js files
check it out : 👉

## Dynamic Import
        document.addEventListener("click", async() => {
            const module = await import(./file name);
            module.clickEvent();
        });

## Strict Mode
This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The statement `use strict;` instructs the browser to use the Strict mode, which is a reduced and safer feature set of JavaScript.

Without strict mode, certain statements might not generate an error at all – even
if they are not allowed – 

`Benifits of using use strict`

- eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
- Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations.
- Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript.

How to use strict mode:
   Two methods to use strict mode there are,
   - Whole-script strict mode syntax 
   - Function-level strict mode

## Literal Values

JavaScript Literals are constant values that can be assigned to the variables that are called literals. There are different types of literals that are supported by JavaScript.
1.Integer Literals - 1; 
2.String Literals  - "string";
3.Array Literals   - [];
4.Object Literals  - {};
5.Boolean Literals  - true/false;

Each literal value usually has a constructor function associated with it.

## Variables

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
1.var
2.let
3.const
But These declaration don't determine the variable's type.

`Dynamic Typing`

JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. It means that variables created using
var or let keywords can be dynamically re-assigned to a value of another type at
some point later in your JavaScript program.

In statically-typed languages doing that would generate an error.

## Passing Values By Reference

In Pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments does not create its own copy, it refers to the original value so changes happens in any of the parameter it affect the original value.

Check it out : 👉

## Scope Quirks
The let keyword doesn’t `hoist definitions`.

Check it out : 👉

## Dos and Dont’s

- Do use the entry point to initialize the default state of your data and objects.
- Do make your program entry point either DOMContentLoaded, readyState or
- the native window.onload method for waiting on media (see next,) depending on
whether you need to wait for just the DOM or the rest of media.
- Do not write your code just in <script> tags, without entry point function.
